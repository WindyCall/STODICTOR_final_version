          As a store manager, the futures sales of your products is one of the
          biggest things that is relevant to your revenue. The prediction of
          future sales is important for the logistic management of your markets
          since you may not want to pile up too many stocks in your factory, nor
          do you want to have a too empty factory which will cost you an extra
          renting fee.Â

          Therefore, here we develop an accounting system with sales predicting
          feature so that it will be easy to know and adjust the future sales of
          our existing stocks. In this way, we could change the purchase
          strategy of the stocks we have to optimize our factory loading, which
          optimizes the logistic management cost.
